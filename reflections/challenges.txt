1) One challenge I have is re-training my development thinking to take advantage of Ruby. The code I write --
or the way I think about designing and implementing code -- is very much informed by statically typed languages like
C#, Java, and C++ (and the way libraries for those languages work). I want to get some more practice outside my
current work (automation) using Ruby to implement other kinds of solutions.

2) I live in the country so working remote is one of my only options. There are many remote opportunities with Ruby,
so I feel the need to be really fluent in Ruby and Rails so I can bring good business value to any place I might work.
