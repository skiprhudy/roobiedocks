1) Develop a better base knowledge of Ruby.

2) Fill in gaps in my Ruby knowledge. Right now I work a lot with website automation, but that doesn't expose me to
enough Ruby software patterns.

3) Have a set of projects that exercise my Ruby skills that I can reference later as documented examples of how to
implement certain programming tasks.

4) Get a better background for my Rails learning.

It may seem odd that someone with my level of experience is taking a "beginning" Ruby nanodegree. I have worked in
many different technology stacks but have concluded that I prefer Ruby. I intend on focusing on Ruby and Rails for
the remainder of my tech career. This course gives me a chance to do various solutions with Ruby and get feedback
from other Rubyists.
