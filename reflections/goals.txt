1) Develop a better base knowledge of Ruby that is directly comparable with other Rubyists.
2) Fill in gaps in my Ruby knowledge. Right now I work a lot with website automation, but that doesn't expose me to enough Ruby software patterns.
3) Have a set of projects that exercise my Ruby skills that I can reference later as documented examples of how to implement certain tasks.
4) Get a better background for my Rails learning.
5) Do better on live coding interviews.
