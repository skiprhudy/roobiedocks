1) I have many years of experience in software development: from QA development to software architect.

2) I have a BS in Geology, an MA in Germanic Languages, and have done a ton of coursework in CS at Texas State
University, Austin Community College, UT, and even one of the OMSCS classes at Georgia Tech, also classes at Udacity,
basically giving me the equivalent of BS in CS. My favorite non-tech job was teaching German at The University
of Texas at Austin and at a private school in Frankfurt, Germany (yes, I taught German in Germany -- kinda crazy :)

3) Using Ruby / RSpec / Watir / Appium for last 2 years in automation work.

4) I cannot stop learning. It's one of the most fun things for me.

Work history, in ascending order: Cirrus Logic, Charles Schwab & Co, VersaSuite, Onlife Health, Bluefly.

I have done pretty much every tech role from QA developer to junior developer to senior developer to systems architect
and now SDET / QA Architect. I've steered away from management roles.
