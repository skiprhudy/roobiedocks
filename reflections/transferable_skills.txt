1) Years of experience in software development: from QA development to software architect. It may seem odd that someone with my level of experience am taking a "beginning" Ruby nanodegree. I have worked in many different technology stacks but have concluded that I prefer Ruby. I'm more productive with it and intend on focusing on Ruby for the remainder of my tech career.

2) I have a BS in Geology, an MA in Germanic Languages, and have done a ton of coursework in CS basically giving me the equivalent of BS in CS. I was in the first cohort at Georgia Tech's OMSCS -- but had to stop because the work load was too much for my family's health :)

3) I cannot stop learning. I just can't.
